# About

This course traces the principal economic, social and political transformations in Latin America from the Wars of Independence to the present in order to understand the roots of ethnic conflict, social inequality and political instability in modern Latin America. Why is there so much poverty in Latin America? What has been the role of the United States in the region? How does the military maintain such power in politics? Why is Latin music so damn good? These and other questions will be addressed in lectures, readings, films and discussions. The class will use a comparative framework to address topics such as the consolidation of nation states and their insertion in the world economy after Independence; changes in land use and labor organization; political movements for liberalism, populism, and revolution; popular culture; industrialization and class politics; military regimes and subsequent redemocratization; U.S. policy and intervention; and the emergence of contemporary social movements in the context of neoliberal economies.

While some familiarity with Latin America will be helpful, this is an introduction to the history of the region since the end of colonial rule.

# Readings

This semester, I am not requiring you to purchase any books. All readings will be provided to the student electronically.

# Course Requirements

Students are required to engage in this class. Learning is an interactive process, and requires active participation by all members of the class. Students need to read, write, and attend lecture in order to be successful in this class. The history of Latin America is being written as we speak in the quotidian actions of indigenous people, politicians, artists, and more. Likewise, history reverberates in the events of today, as well as their meanings. As part of this course, students are required to read news from Latin America. In addition to these weekly activities, there are a series of formal assignments.

These assignments are designed to contribute to the overall objectives of the semester, including both content-specific and skill-based goals.

# Course Objectives

1.  To introduce students to the forces, events, and conflicts that defined the process of nation building in the Americas, including:
    -   The legacies of Spanish imperial rule on the new nation states of 19th-century Latin America.
    -   The historical processes of inclusion and exclusion in building new nations.
    -   The role of indigenous people in building and contesting modern Latin American societies
    -   The role of the United States in shaping the political economy of modern Latin America.
    -   The expressions in Latin American popular culture of the tensions within society.
2.  To understand and use a variety of sources that provide the core of historical inquiry.
    -   Primary written sources, and their particular challenges.
    -   Secondary sources, and how to read them critically.
    -   Visual and physical sources of evidence.
    -   The absence of sources— finding lost voices, and reading against the grain.
3.  To be able to identify, understand, and critique historical argument.
    -   Historians follow a lose set of epistemological, theoretical, and evidentiary rules in their attempts to recreate the limited past that is accessible to us through our incomplete archival record. At the college level and beyond, it is your task to learn how to identify an author’s central argument and to evaluate it based on its evidence, sources, logic, and narrative.
