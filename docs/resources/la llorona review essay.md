### Plot

In *La Llorona,* Guatemala's first ever Academy Award submission to make the short list for Best Foreign Film, director Jayro Bustamante takes a fresh twist on a common Mesoamerican folktale. La llorona, the weeping woman, is a malign spirit whose ghost haunts bodies of water, crying for her children that she drowned. The apparition threatens to take other children in an act of horrifying repetition. The folktale is old, with roots at least to the 16th century and the Spanish colonial period, and in recent decades became a popular motif for film, television, and music. Bustamante's *weeping woman* deviates from the tradition by focusing her haunting on the perpetrator of unspeakable crimes. In this way, the filmmaker puts the genre of horror to use in dealing with the collective trauma of a nation wracked by a violent, genocidal, dirty war against its own people. 

The fictional General and former President Enrique Monteverde is being put on trial for crimes against humanity and acts of genocide during Guatemala's Civil War of the 1980s. The character is based on the real-life General and President Efraín Ríos Montt, an evangelical protestant and ally of the Reagan Administration in its war of containment in Central America.

The film largely centers on Monteverde and his family, both in the courtroom and hidden behind walls in their luxurious private compound. In the courtroom, elaborately dressed Mayan women, survivors of the atrocities, testify against him. His family is forced to listen to their sober pleas. At home, despite protesting masses beyond the gates, Monteverde and family hope to escape the scrutiny, finding refuge in one another, God, and their staff of Indigenous servants. It is in the context that Monteverde comes to be haunted by his past, by the water spirit of the weeping woman, who is a product of his horror even as she torments his present.
