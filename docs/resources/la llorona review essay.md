### Plot

In *La Llorona,* Guatemala's first ever Academy Award submission to make the short list for Best Foreign Film, director Jayro Bustamante takes a fresh twist on a common Mesoamerican folktale. La llorona, the weeping woman, is a malign spirit whose ghost haunts bodies of water, crying for her children that she drowned. The folktale is old, with roots at least to the 16th century and the Spanish colonial period. In the 20th century, the tale became a popular motif for film, television, and music.
