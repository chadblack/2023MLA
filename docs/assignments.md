## in-class writing (20%)

Occasionally, at the start of class, you will be asked to write a short paragraph or take a quiz on the day’s or week’s readings. These will be graded as either 0 (did not respond to the issues), 1 (shows knowledge of the text’s issues), or 2 (shows knowledge of the text’s issues and relates them to our course’s themes). You get one free miss for any reason whatsoever. But this also means that any misses over two will count regardless of excuses. Note that a score of “0” is one you’d probably like to drop as your free miss. In other words, don’t do what some have in the past: skip one class and then get sick for a second, because that second, sick miss will count. 

## in-class exams (25% each)

There will be two exams- a midterm and final. 

## how to get rich in Latin America (15%)

## film reaction (15%)
